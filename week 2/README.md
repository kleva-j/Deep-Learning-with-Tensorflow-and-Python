In this chapter, we were able to create a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to pattern match a set of images of fashion items to label. After training our model we were to able to classify with pretty high accuracy on the training set, but a little less on the test set. 
In this method of training our model we were able to look at the individual pixels of each image and comparing the value of the
